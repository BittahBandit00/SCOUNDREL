HOW TO PLAY

Welcome to SCOUNDREL — a fast, brutal, card-driven dungeon crawl.
Your goal is simple: survive the deck and outlast the dungeon.

The deck *is* the dungeon. Every card you draw is a room filled with an enemy,
a weapon, or a potion. You begin with 20 Health. If it reaches zero, your run
ends immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ROOM STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each turn, you reveal the top four cards of the deck. Choose one to resolve;
the others remain until the room is cleared. When only one card remains,
three new cards are drawn to refill the room.

Face cards use their printed number. Aces count as 14.
Card values:
  J = 11
  Q = 12
  K = 13
  A = 14

  ENEMIES   ♣ / ♠
      • Their value is their attack strength — you take that much damage.
      • Your weapon reduces incoming damage by its value.
      • With NO weapon, you always take the full attack value.
      • You may choose to fight an enemy with your FISTS at any time.
      • Fist fights ignore your weapon and deal full damage.

  WEAPONS   ♦
      • Picking up a weapon replaces your current one immediately.
      • Defeating an enemy sets your weapon's durability to its value.
      • If your weapon's durability is lower than the enemy's strength,
        it fails to protect you and deals no damage reduction.
      • A failed weapon strike forces a fist fight instead.
      • Choosing to fist fight does NOT destroy your weapon.

  POTIONS   ♥
      • Potions heal you for their value when selected.
      • You may drink ONE potion per room — choose wisely.
      • Healing cannot exceed your maximum health - extra healing is lost.
      • Drinking additional potions in the same room wastes them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ACTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the start of each room, you may choose to FIGHT or RUN.

  FIGHT
      • Select a card (1–4) and resolve its effect immediately.
      • Add 'B' or 'F' to your choice to fight with your fists.
        Example: '2B' fights card 2 using your fists.
      • Defeating an enemy with a red weapon reduces its durability.
      • A weapon with reduced durabili ty can only block enemies
        whose value is lower than its current durability.
      • Fist attacks ignore your weapon and deal full damage.
      • Fist attacks never change or replace your weapon.

  RUN
      • Sends all 4 cards to the *bottom* of the deck.
      • Cannot be used twice in a row - no coward loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You win when the deck is empty and the final room is cleared.
Clear the entire deck without dying. Every room is a gamble,
every choice a wager, and every victory hard-earned.

Good luck, Scoundrel.
