HOW TO PLAY

==============================================================================

Welcome to SCOUNDREL - a fast, brutal, card-driven dungeon crawl.
Your goal is simple: survive the deck and outlast the dungeon.

The deck *is* the dungeon. Every card you draw is a room filled with an enemy,
a weapon, or a potion. You begin with 20 Health. If it reaches zero, your run
ends immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 ROOM STRUCTURE
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each turn, you reveal the top four cards of the deck. Choose one to resolve;
the others remain until the room is cleared. When only one card remains,
three new cards are drawn to refill the room.

Face cards use their printed number. Aces count as 14.

Card values:

  J = 11
  
  Q = 12
  
  K = 13
  
  A = 14
  

  ENEMIES   ♣ / ♠
  
      • An enemy's value is its attack strength - you take that much damage.
      • Your weapon can reduce this damage when it applies.
      • With no weapon, you always take the full attack value.
      • You may choose to fight an enemy with your FISTS at any time.
      • Fist fights ignore your weapon and you receive full damage.

  WEAPONS   ♦
  
      • Picking up a diamond card gives you a weapon with that card's value.
      • A fresh weapon can be used against any enemy, reducing damage
        by its value, even if the enemy's value is higher.
      • When you defeat an enemy using your weapon, its durability
        becomes that enemy's value.
      • After that, your weapon only protects you against enemies
        with a LOWER value than its current durability.
      • If you use your weapon against an enemy whose value is not lower,
        it fails to protect you and you take full damage.
      • Fist fights do not use or change your weapon's durability.
      • Tip: Use fresh, high-value weapons to safely fight strong enemies
        before your durability locks in to a lower value.

  POTIONS   ♥
  
      • Potions heal you for their value when selected.
      • You may drink ONE potion per room — choose wisely.
      • Healing cannot exceed your maximum health - extra healing is lost.
      • Drinking additional potions in the same room wastes them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ACTIONS
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the start of each room, you may choose to FIGHT or RUN.

  FIGHT
  
      • Select a card (1-4) and resolve its effect immediately.
      • Add 'B' or 'F' to fight with your fists.
        Example: '2F' fights card 2 using your fists.
      • If you defeat an enemy using a red weapon, its durability
        becomes that enemy's value (see WEAPONS section).
      • A weapon only protects you if its durability is higher
        than the enemy's value.
      • Fist attacks ignore your weapon and always deal full damage.

  RUN
  
      • Sends all 4 cards to the *bottom* of the deck.
      • Cannot be used twice in a row - no coward loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 OBJECTIVE
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You win when the deck is empty and the final room is cleared.
Clear the entire deck without dying. Every room is a gamble,
every choice a wager, and every victory hard-earned.

Good luck, Scoundrel.
